Notes,28,0.0,0.0,11,"{""At Times Square, a number of passageways connect the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line, IRT Flushing Line, IRT 42nd Street Shuttle, and BMT Broadway Line. A block-long passageway west to the IND Eighth Avenue Line is also inside fare control. The first transfer here was between the original IRT subway (now the shuttle platforms) and the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, opened on June 3, 1917, when the latter line opened as a shuttle to 34th Street – Penn Station. The Flushing Line was extended to Times Square on March 14, 1927, and a passageway connecting the IRT and BMT was placed inside fare control on July 1, 1948. The same was done with the connection to the Eighth Avenue Line in December 1988."": 5, ""The subway station at Grand Central Terminal serves the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, IRT Flushing Line, and IRT 42nd Street Shuttle. Connections are closely integrated, since all three lines were operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The original station, opened on October 27, 1904, served only the first IRT subway, and is now the shuttle platforms. The Flushing Line station opened on June 22, 1915, and the Lexington Avenue Line station on July 17, 1918, each with direct connections to the existing station.[citation needed] The elevated IRT Second Avenue Line was closed on June 13, 1942, and, starting the next day, a paper transfer was available between the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line and the Grand Central complex. This allowed passengers who had taken the Second Avenue Line over the Queensboro Bridge to instead use the Third Avenue Line to Lower Manhattan. The Third Avenue Line closed on May 12, 1955, ending this transfer."": 4, ""The passageways between the Broadway Line and the upper-level local Lexington Avenue Line stations were placed inside fare control on July 1, 1948. When the lower-level express Lexington Avenue platforms opened in 1962 to relieve congestion at the Grand Central – 42nd Street transfer point, those platforms were connected to the local platforms and Broadway Line platforms above. A MetroCard transfer to the IND 63rd Street Line was added on December 16, 2001, when the Queens section of that line was completed. Since the F had moved to the new line, there was no longer a direct transfer to the Lexington Avenue Line, and so this transfer was added with an above-ground walk, free for MetroCard users within two hours of the original boarding."": 3, ""The BMT Broadway Line and IND Sixth Avenue Line, which lie on top of each other, received a transfer at the time of the July 1, 1948 fare increase. An existing connection was placed inside fare control."": 2, ""A paper transfer was added between the IND Sixth Avenue Line and IRT Flushing Line at Bryant Park on July 1, 1968, when KK service started and the new 57th Street station opened. The transfer was only valid on weekdays from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. until a passageway was opened by 1971."": 2}",461.179,313.0,0.0
